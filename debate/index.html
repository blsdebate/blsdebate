        <h1>Debate</h1>
        <h2>Public Forum (PF)</h2>
        <p>
            In PF, there is never any worry about debating alone. Like a dual tennis match, PF is a two-on-two format with topics changing every 1-2 months and lots of time for team preparation. Debate topics range from the technological high speed rail to Japan’s pacific Constitution. In PF, you get to be the advocator, whether it’d be for policy implementation in schools systems or environmental contentions worldwide.

            Lincoln-Douglas (LD)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Morals may or may not be subjective, which is exactly why it’s absolutely debateable! LD appeals to all who wish to debate alone in a one-on-one format to synthesize elegant argumentation on topics changing every 2 months that concern values and justice. For example, should classified information be leaked to address public injustices? LD is filled with plenty of speaking time for each competitor to truly shine. 
        </p>    
        <h2>Big Questions (BQ)</h2>
        <p>         
            Did the chicken come first or the egg? Calling all philosophical ponderers - BQ might be the event for you. Formatted as an individual or partner event, BQ follows a similar debate round structure to PF, but its topics concern intersections of religion, science, morals, and other large concepts.
