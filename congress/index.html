        <h1>Congress</h1>
        <p>Picture speaking on the Congressional floor of the United States, but in a classroom. In Congress, students model members of the United States Congress by discussing pieces of legislation, including bills and resolutions within a “chamber” of competitors. If you are looking for a form of debate filled with rhetoric but still captures the “edge” of debate, Congress is for you. 
            (Fun fact: The Massachusetts State Debate League classifies Congress as a not speech but also not debate event because it’s the perfect intersection of both!)
