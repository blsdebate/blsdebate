        <p id="thing1">Welcome to the Boston Latin School Speech & Debate website!
            We love trying new foods in whatever locations our tournaments take us, bonding over karaoke game nights, and politely yelling at people for awards. (All jokes - we don’t bite :)) If you’re interested in improving your persuasive capacity to win over parents at the dinner table, performing in front of audiences with personalized pieces, or even just to dip your toes for a bit of public speaking experience, JOIN THE BLS DEBATE FAM NOW!

        <h2>Pledge To Diversity</h2>
        <p>
            We at Boston Latin School Speech and Debate believe that racial, ethnic, religious, gender identity and socioeconomic diversity are vital to strengthening both our team and the speech and debate community at large. As such we pride ourselves on being a club for all students from all backgrounds. 
The Speech and Debate Community has not always been welcoming and as the National Organization works to change that, Boston Latin must do it’s part to be a part of that change. Our status as a Public Exam School that is rapidly diversifying puts us in a unique position to teach and showcase speech and debate excellence across all backgrounds and we are committed to that goal.
As teammates we respect different backgrounds, viewpoints and perspectives and work together to build cases and arguments that give voice to and respect marginalized groups. We do not engage in problematic argumentation or speeches and think carefully about the implications of our arguments and speeches before we run them. 
Our coaches operate an “open door” policy for any team member to reach out and address concerns about arguments, speeches, tournaments, or other issues. We take complaints seriously and encourage students to speak to us should problems arise.
We, the coaching staff and officer team, want speech and debate to grow in diversity in the coming years. We are doing our part to ensure it does and expect students who are a part of this club to do the same.
